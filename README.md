# Estimating-Concrete-Strength-using-Regression-Analysis
The project topic “Estimating Concrete strength using Regression Analysis” which is using concrete dataset to build a model that estimates the strength value using various attributes that is used to build any property like houses, buildings, etc. The dataset concrete is about how different attributes in quantity and ratio are used for building any house so that its strength is maximum enough to live as long as one lives because these properties are long term investments as well as people want it to be strong so that it protects them in hazardous situations.
